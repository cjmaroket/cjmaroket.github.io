      <h1>Hope for Huemanity</h1>
      <p id="headlinecopy">The Huemanity Project is a humble initiative fueled by a big dream: to paint the world with a little more color and to fill hearts with a little more hope.</p>

      <h2>The Humans</h2>
      <p>A single person cannot save the world, but the collective effort of many can create ripples. The Huemanity Project hopes to touch as many lives as humanly possible through small fundraising campaigns. Eventually, the goal is to continually raise funds and awareness for important causes.</p>

        <h3>Kickstarter: #AidRefugees</h3>
	    <p>When Kickstarter initiated a crowdfunding campaign for refugees, I immediately knew that I wanted to support the project. To raise funds, I sold some personal calligraphy supplies to friends from Instagram. 100% of the profits went towards the Kickstarter campaign.</p>

      <h2>The Hues</h2>
      <p>At the moment, I create all calligraphy and watercolor pieces. Soon though, I hope that I can tap other artist friends who want to share their works for a good cause.</p>

          <h3>Lettered Feathers</h3>
	      <p>I created this custom lettered feather for my friend, Jodean, who gave me complete artistic freedom in creating the design. Her only request was that I make a lettered feather for the word “joy”. To create a happy vibe, I went for yellow and pink. Between you and me, this is my favorite lettered feather so far.</p>
